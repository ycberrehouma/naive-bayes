Implement Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch to predict if a person makes over 50K a year. Again, you cant use an API that implements Naive Bayes, but implementing intermediate functions as API is fine.

dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

Compute: Precision, recall, accuracy (you can use APIs for these functions)

Process: do a hold out method of your dataset with the following split

60-40, 70-30, 80-20 (training-testing)

What you need to submit:

a. Code

b. a document describing your approach as well as three graphs,

  1. Y- axis: precision, x axis: hold out split

  2. Y- axis: recall, x axis: hold out split

  3. Y- axis: accuracy, x axis: hold out split
